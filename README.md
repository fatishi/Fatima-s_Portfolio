## Projects
## [Predicting Causes for Chicago Traffic Crashes](https://github.com/fatishi/My_Portfolio/tree/main/Analytics%20System%20Technology)

**Description:** A group project that I did with my teammate (Min-Chi Tsai) based on the real-data obtained from the Chicago Data Portal. The goal of the project is to help Chicago Police Department to predict the traffic crash type and understand the causes that lead to it. We are wondering if there are similar or common patterns that might help to predict the traffic crash. The main question we intended to answer in this analysis is “What factors affect the severity of the traffic crash type?”. 
* Performed EDA and cleaning of data with 605,120 records as of May, 2022
* Pre-processed data: reducing feature cardinality, feature engineering, splitting, and scaling for ML models creation
* Built 3 ML models: logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost to predict influential factors on traffic crashes in 2022

**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Descriptive Statistics, Visualization, Writing Functions, Feature Engineering, Predictive Modeling, Classification  

**Technology:** Python: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Datetime, Sklearn, Statsmodels, Xgboost
