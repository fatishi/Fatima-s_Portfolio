## Projects 
## [Predicting Causes for Chicago Traffic Crashes (Classification)](https://github.com/fatishi/My_Portfolio/tree/main/Analytics%20System%20Technology)

- **Code file:** [`Final Python_ALY6140_group5.ipynb`](https://github.com/fatishi/My_Portfolio/blob/main/Analytics%20System%20Technology/Final%20Python_ALY6140_group5.ipynb)
- **Project Report:** [`Final Report_ALY6140_group5.pdf`](https://github.com/fatishi/My_Portfolio/blob/main/Analytics%20System%20Technology/Final%20Report_ALY6140_group5.pdf)

**Description:** A group project that I did with my teammate (Min-Chi Tsai) based on the real-data obtained from the Chicago Data Portal. The goal of the project is to help Chicago Police Department to predict the traffic crash type and understand the causes that lead to it. We are wondering if there are similar or common patterns that might help to predict the traffic crash. The main question we intended to answer in this analysis is ‚ÄúWhat factors affect the severity of the traffic crash type?‚Äù. 
* Performed EDA and cleaning of data with 605,120 records as of May, 2022
* Pre-processed data: reducing feature cardinality, feature engineering, splitting, and scaling for ML models creation
* Built 3 ML models: logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost to predict influential factors on traffic crashes in 2022

**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Descriptive Statistics, Visualization, Writing Functions, Feature Engineering, Predictive Modeling, Classification  

**Technology:** Python: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Datetime, Sklearn, Statsmodels, Xgboost

**Description:** A group project that I did with my teammates based on the data set about the bike rental information collected mainly from Washington D.C in 2011 and 2012. This project aims to analyze the demand changes for bike-sharing by different periods and weather conditions as well as the different behavior patterns of the 2 user types - casual users and registered users. Based on the findings, we also provided suggestions to the bike-sharing company from a product and marketing manager perspective. Here we raised questions from 2 aspects that would help us understand the user behaviors of bike sharing:
1. What are the time patterns of bike-sharing? Any difference between the 2 user types?
2. How do the weather conditions influence the number of bike rentals regarding specific user types?

**Skills:** EDA, Descriptive Statistics, Visualization, Time-Series Analysis, Frequency Distribution

**Technology:** Tableau: Heatmap, Bar Chart, Line Chart, Time-Series
