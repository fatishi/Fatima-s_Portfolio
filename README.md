**Description:** A final capstone project sponsored by Free Float Media is an Empirical Study on Board Directors in US Companies (2017-2022) that I did with my teammates based on more than 10 data sets provided. The project goal is to analyze the structural aftermath of the director boards during their firms‚Äô disclosed controversial events by predicting their likelihood of departure and finding the factors affecting it. The report covers various aspects of our research such as literature reviews, research methodologies and hypotheses, data analysis, modeling, and so on. The main question we intended to answer in this analysis is:

*"How each characteristic of the individual director influences the departure when their companies involve controversial events?"*

**What I did?**
* Implemented the warehousing for 10 data sources & Created visualization dashboards on Power BI for Exploratory Data Analysis.
* Used Python for data cleaning/engineering and Generated 6 features on the directors' level (individual characteristics).
* Applied machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.) to predict the departure probability (accuracy:85%).
* Implemented Automated machine learning process using Python PyCaret library for the best model among 14 possible.

**Skills:** Hypotheses Testing, EDA, Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Feature Engineering, Descriptive Analysis, Visualization, Writing Functions, Predictive Modeling, Classification  

**> Technology:** **Power BI, Excel, Python**: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn, Statsmodels, Pycaret

**Description:** A group project that I did with my teammates based on the data set from a UK-based online sales store. It contains records of more than 1 million transactions from January 12, 2009, to September 12, 2011. We created a Manual with instructions for doing data analysis, especially the Market Basket Analysis by using Apriori Algorithm for the retail industry. The purpose of this report is to help analysts who have no experience using the big data management tool ‚Äì Databricks understand how to use it to tackle real big data. The main question we intended to answer in this analysis is *‚ÄúHow to create a better product bundle sales strategy for online retail companies by using Market Basket Analysis?‚Äù*. 

* Conducted EDA and MBA with Apriori Algorithm using PySpark and SQL to study large transaction data with over 1 billion
records of UK-based online retail companies.
* Recommended better product bundle sales strategy to increase revenue based on insights of top-most sold product combinations.
* Created a Manual of 50 pages with step-by-step instructions for doing data analysis on Databricks.

**Skills:** Data Cleaning, EDA, Data Transformation, Visualization, Market Basket Analysis, Association Rule Learning

**Technology:** Excel, Apache Spark, Databricks: Apriori Algorithm, PySpark, SQL

**Description:** A group project that I did with my teammate (Min-Chi Tsai) based on the real-data obtained from the Chicago Data Portal. The goal of the project is to help Chicago Police Department to predict the traffic crash type and understand the causes that lead to it. We are wondering if there are similar or common patterns that might help to predict the traffic crash. The main question we intended to answer in this analysis is *‚ÄúWhat factors affect the severity of the traffic crash type?‚Äù*. 
* Performed EDA and cleaning of data with 605,120 records as of May, 2022
* Pre-processed data: reducing feature cardinality, feature engineering, splitting, and scaling for ML models creation
* Built 3 ML models: logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost to predict influential factors on traffic crashes in 2022

**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Descriptive Statistics, Visualization, Writing Functions, Feature Engineering, Predictive Modeling, Classification

**Description:** A group project that I did with my teammates based on the data set about the bike rental information collected mainly from Washington D.C in 2011 and 2012. This project aims to analyze the demand changes for bike-sharing by different periods and weather conditions as well as the different behavior patterns of the 2 user types - casual users and registered users. Based on the findings, we also provided suggestions to the bike-sharing company from a product and marketing manager perspective. Here we raised questions from 2 aspects that would help us understand the user behaviors of bike sharing:
1. *What are the time patterns of bike-sharing? Any difference between the 2 user types?*
2. *How do the weather conditions influence the number of bike rentals regarding specific user types?*

**Skills:** EDA, Descriptive Statistics, Visualization, Time-Series Analysis, Frequency Distribution

**Technology:** Tableau: Heatmap, Bar Chart, Line Chart, Time-Series
